                As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
                 <span>I felt deeply moved, and stirred.
                    It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
                   <mark>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</mark>
                    In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes,
                     his locks of hair that trembled in the wind
                     , and I said to myself: <strong>"What I see here is nothing but a shell.
                        What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</strong> As his lips opened slightly with the suspision
                      of a half-smile. I said to myself, again: <strong>"What moves me so deeply, about this little princess
                        who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines
                        through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</strong> And I felt him to be
                      more fragile still.<span>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might
                        be exstinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
